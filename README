                          =======================
                            "pgrep" - perl grep
                          =======================

Did you ever want to have a "grep" combined with the power of Perl's
regular expressions?

Here it is!

This tool accepts the usual options for "grep":

    -i    ignore case
    -l    list filenames only
    -v    invert search
    --    end of options

The tool prints a usage if called without parameters.

For more information on "grep", see its corresponding manual pages on
your UNIX system.

Note that this tool is not restricted to UNIX platforms, though, it will
run wherever Perl does!

Just install this tool somewhere in your search path, e.g. "/usr/local/bin".

Don't forget to adjust the shell-bang line (the first line of the script)
to match the path where Perl is installed on your system.

Non-UNIX users please refer to the documentation of their Perl installation
for instructions on how to install Perl scripts as executable applications.

Enjoy!
